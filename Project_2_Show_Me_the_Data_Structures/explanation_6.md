"Union and Intersection"Explanation:To solve the union_and_intersection problem I create a helper function named create_set that takes-in a LinkedList andreturn a set of the values of each node in the LinkedList. I use this helper function either to create the unionLinkedList (Once I get the sets of the values of the LinkedLists I create a union with both sets using the '|' operatorand iterate over that union creating a new LinkedList withe the values of this set) and the intersectionLinkedList (Once I get the sets of the values of the LinkedLists I create an intersection of the sets using the '&'operator and iterate over that intersection creating a new LinkedList with the values of this set).Complexity:The run time complexity is O(n + m) where n and m are the sizes of the original LinkedListsThe space complexity is also O(n + m) where n and m are the sizes of the original LinkedLists
