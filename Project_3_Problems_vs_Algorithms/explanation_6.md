Explanation:
In two variables I store the biggest and smallest value using float('inf') and float('-inf'), then iterate over the list
and compare the values, keeping the smallest and biggest updated.




Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of element in the list, we have to iterate over the complete list.
The space complexity is O(1), we don't use any extra memory.
